	<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
	<p class="date">Last Updated June 7, 2016</p>
<p>This is our terms of service. As a courtesy to you, on the left side, we have done our best to translate the legalese into a easy readable format. You should know though that the language on the right is the legally binding format.</p>
<div class="one-half-legal first">
	<div class="easy">
	<p>Unless you work for a company that has negotiated a separate agreement with us, these are the terms that apply to your use of Jonah Levi's services. You should read them.</p>

	<p>You should especially read Sections 11 and 13 because they limit our liability to you if something goes wrong.</p>

	<p>Also, if we get into a dispute, we will have to figure it out in arbitration. Review Section 17 for more details.</p>

<h3>Disclaimer of Liability</h3>

<p>Except as otherwise provided in the standard terms of sale that govern the sale of each product of Jonah Levi, the products offered for sale by Jonah Levi or its partners and the transactions conducted through it are provided by us on an “as is” basis. We make no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, as to the operation of the Site or the information, content, materials, or products included on this Site. To the full extent permissible by applicable law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, title, quiet enjoyment, data accuracy and system integration. This Site may include inaccuracies, mistakes or typographical errors. We do not warrant that the content will be uninterrupted or error free. </p>

</div>

<div class="one-half-legal first">
	<div class="easy">
<p>We both agree to follow the law.</p>
<p>Just because we don't enforce some part of these terms against you now doesn't mean we can't start enforcing them against you later.</p>
<p>These terms don't create any special relationship between us, like employer-employee, joint venture, or a partnership. Nothing will change that.

We both will be responsible for our own employees.</p>

<p>If any part of these terms is not enforceable, the rest of the terms will still be enforceable.</p>

<p>This is the only set of terms that governs our relationship.</p>

<p>If one of us can not keep our promises because something beyond our control happens (think earthquake, massive power outage, war), then that does not count as a breach of these terms.</p>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="one-half-legal fine-print">
<h3>General</h3>

<p>Both you and Jonah Levi will comply with the applicable law relating to each of our respective activities under these Terms, including privacy and data protection laws and applicable rules established by the Federal Communications Commission. </p>

<p>Jonah Levi's failure to enforce at any time any provision of these Terms does not waive our right to do so later. And, if we do expressly waive any provision of these Terms, that does not mean it is waived for all time in the future. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by and us to be legally binding.</p>

<p>You and Jonah Levi are independent contractors in the performance of each and every part of these Terms. Nothing in these Terms is intended to create or shall be construed as creating an employer-employee relationship or a partnership, agency, joint venture, or franchise. You and Jonah Levi will be solely responsible for all of our respective employees and agents and our respective labor costs and expenses arising in connection with our respective employees and agents. You and Jonah Levi will also be solely responsible for any and all claims, liabilities or damages or debts of any type that may arise on account of each of our respective activities, or those of each of our respective employees or agents, in the performance of these Terms. Neither you nor Jonah Levi has the authority to commit the other of us in any way and will not attempt to do so or imply that it has the right to do so.</p>

<p>If any provision of these Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable and, in any event, the rest of these Terms will continue in full force and effect.</p>

<p>Except as provided in these Terms and any attachments to these Terms, these Terms supersede all prior and contemporaneous proposals, statements, sales materials or presentations and agreements, oral and written. No oral or written information or advice given by Jonah Levi, its agents or employees will create a warranty or in any way increase the scope of the warranties in these Terms.</p>

<p>No failure, delay or default in performance of any obligation of a party shall constitute an event of default or breach of these Terms to the extent that such failure to perform, delay or default arises out of a cause, existing or future, that is beyond the control and without negligence of such party, including action or inaction of governmental, civil or military authority; fire; strike, lockout or other labor dispute; flood, terrorist act; war; riot; theft; earthquake and other natural disaster. The party affected by such cause shall take all reasonable actions to minimize the consequences of any such cause.</p>
